# Connect Wallet and MintButton Prototype

This page has basic connect wallet functionality (the production build will probably use Web3Modal) and a mint button to mint NFTs on testnet. The etherscan link where you can monitor contract transactions is: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x8C72DBb556f31Cfd23C075598bD70Fa03EfaBa64#code

To use, setup a metamask account (do not use your real account as this is a prototype) and connect to the Rinkeby Network.
You can get testnet ETH here: https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby

To run this project, clone the repo and run:

```shell
npm install
npm run start
```
